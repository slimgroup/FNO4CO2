# FourierNeuralOperator.jl

This repository is an implementation of Fourier Neural Operator from [Fourier Neural Operator for Parameter Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895) authored by Zongyi Li, Nikola Kovachki, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, et al. The [original repository](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator) is in python.

In order to run the example, please first download "Darcy_421.zip" from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UnbQh2WWc6knEHbLn-ZaXrKUZhp7pjt-?usp=sharing), unpack it, and rename the folder to "data".
