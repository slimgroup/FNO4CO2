# FNO4CO2

This repository contains the implementation of learned coupled inversion framework and the numerical experiments in [Learned coupled inversion for carbon sequestration monitoring and forecasting with Fourier neural operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14396).

The aforementioned framework entails a re-implementation of Fourier neural operators from [Fourier Neural Operator for Parameter Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895) authored by Zongyi Li et al. The [original repository](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator) is in python.

This code base is using the Julia Language and [DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> FNO

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

1. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
2. Download [python](https://www.python.org/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). The numerical experiments are reproducible by python 3.7 and Julia 1.5.
3. Install [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/), a python package used for wave simulation.
4. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary Julia packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.

## Examples

The repository currently includes several examples.

`fourier_2d.jl` trains a 2D FNO which maps the coefficients of Poisson equation to its solution. The dataset is provided by [the original FNO repository](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator). `fourier_3d.jl` trains a 3D FNO which maps the permeability to time-varying CO2 concentration in two-phase flow. The dataset is generated by [FwiFlow.jl](https://github.com/lidongzh/FwiFlow.jl) and can be acquired while running the script. The trained 3D network for the two-phase flow example is provided in the repository under `data/TrainedNet`.

`fourier_3d_read.jl` reads the pre-trained network and show that the predicted CO2 concentration snapshots from trained FNO are quite close to the ground truth ones.

`fourier_3d_grad.jl` script shows how to conduct a learned inversion to estimate the intrinsic permeability (input of FNO) from the CO2 concentration snapshots. It uses L-BFGS to iteratively invert the FNO.

`learned_coupled_inversion.jl` script shows how to conduct a learned coupled inversion, i.e. we invert for the intrinsic permeability from time-lapse seismic datasets. The process involves inverting multiple physics as shown in [Coupled Time-Lapse Full-Waveform Inversion for Subsurface Flow Problems Using Intrusive Automatic Differentiation](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019WR027032), while it uses a pre-trained FNO as a surrogate for the fluid-flow solver.

## Acknowledgements

We thank the developers from several software packages in the open-source software community, which we based our implementation on. The FNO is re-implemented following Zongyi Li et al's work in [https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator). The two-phase flow dataset is generated by [FwiFlow.jl](https://github.com/lidongzh/FwiFlow.jl). We use [Devito](https://www.devitoproject.org/) and [JUDI.jl](https://github.com/slimgroup/JUDI.jl) for wave simulations. We use [SetIntersectionProjection](https://github.com/slimgroup/SetIntersectionProjection.jl) for constrained optimization.

This research was carried out with the support of Georgia Research Alliance and partners of the ML4Seismic Center.
